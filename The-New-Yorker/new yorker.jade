			This document exists to study the various typographic implementations and variations of the typefaces used, and those that are under consideration for use, on #[em newyorker.com]. Our goal is to create a standard metric by which to judge the quality, legibility, features, and other properties of each embedded typeface. Furthermore, experimentation and testing are made easier without impacting the rest of the site.

		p.
			The current iteration of the website uses a combination of specialized (and occasionally inaccurate) fonts, mostly loaded from Adobe’s Typekit. Below are examples of each used throughout the site.
			
		ul.examples 
			li.headings.irvin-display
				h3.heading.smallest Irvin Display
				p.description
					em 55px. Used on The Latest, Current Issue overview, Related Stories, Daily Cartoon
				.specimen Look at all of the doodads
				
			li.headings.irvin-display-rounder
				h3.heading.smallest Irvin Display Rounder
				p.description
					em 55px. Also known as NY Irvin Display DE. Variant of Irvin Display with fewer ligatures and word replacements.
				.specimen Look at how fewer doodads there are
				
			li.headings.irvin-heading
				h3.heading.smallest Irvin Heading
				p.description
					em 38px. Used on post titles.
				.specimen A Tasteful Page Title
				
			li.headings.irvin-text
				h3.heading.smallest Irvin Text
				p.description
					em 12px. This variant appears to be used exclusively for rubrics. It's slightly heavier than Irvin Heading and less angular.

			li.body.caslon
					h3.heading.smallest Adobe Caslon (Regular, Bold, Italic & Bold Italic)
					p.description
						em 18px, 150% line-height. Another distinctive typeface sourced from print. We load four versions: regular, bold, italic, and bold-italic. Originally designed in the 18th century, Adobe has added many digital features to it as of 1990 (More information can be found #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caslon#Adobe_Caslon_.281990.29") here]). The version we currently use online does not contain many of the typographic changes that the magazine has made for legibility reasons, such as the removal of certain ligatures.

				li.body.georgia
					h3.heading.smallest Georgia
					p.description
						em 18px, 150% line-height. Georgia is a default font for virtually every device, so including it has a page weight advantage. However, italic and bold versions were deemed unpalatable (especially at larger sizes), so this never served as a full replacement for Caslon on newer templates.

			li.headings.neutra.regular
				h3.heading.smallest Neutra Regular
				p.description
					em 14px. Neutra has many uses throughout the site; including bylines, links, and low-hierarchy titles. As far as I can tell, we only use this weight of Neutra for certain link copy.
				.specimen A Tiny Link »
				
			li.headings.neutra.demi
				h3.heading.smallest Neutra Demi
				p.description
					em 20px. Generally speaking, the regular weight used for headings & titles at lower visual hierarchies.
				.specimen Sometimes, Page Titles Do Not Need to be Overly Emphasized
			
			li.headings.neutra.bold
				h3.heading.smallest Neutra Bold
				p.description
					em 20px. Used for primary navigation links and bylines.

		h2.heading.small Proposed
		
		p.
			The print version of The New Yorker has differing choices for many use cases. For ones that are the same (such as Caslon), we are using outdated equivalents on newyorker.com. Below, we have manually converted original print fonts to WOFF, to ensure maximum parity for tracking, ligatures, hinting, etc. We also aim to eventually move away from TypeKit hosting for performance reasons.

	section.typekit
			
		h4.heading.small TypeKit vs Self-hosting fonts
		
		p Why do we want to move away from TypeKit? What's so bad about it?
			
		ul
			li Loads all fonts at once, regardless of use on the page.
			li Loads two external files at begining of page render, blocking other assets from loading.
			li Not subset (we use only a fraction of the characters & features included in the original files).
			li Our site appearance is tied to TypeKit—if it goes down like last week, so do our fonts.
			
		p What's so great about self-hosting?
			
		ul
			li Fonts are loaded on-demand—if the user has not encountered Caslon Bold-Italic on the page yet, for example, this font will not load.
			li All files are loaded from our own server, which does not block other asset requests.
			li We have direct control over subsetting and compression. This results in much smaller files (sometimes around 50% smaller than TypeKit).
			li First-party hosting means that we never have to worry about what is happening with Adobe's servers.
			
		p Whom else at Condé Nast has done it already?
		
		ul
			li Pitchfork
			li GQ
			li Vanity Fair
			li Vogue
			li Bon Appétit
			li W Magazine
			li Condé Nast Traveler
			li Ars Technica
			li Teen Vogue
			
		p Who hasn't?
		ul
			li Wired
			li Architectural Digest
			
		p And before you ask—yes, the New York #[em Times] self-hosts their own fonts.
		
	section.rendering
			
		h4.heading.small A Note: Rendering
		p.
			It’s important to declare what features we are basing this test on, as this can affect presentation and even implementation of many features, such as antialiasing, hinting, and ligature support. The following properties have been applied to some text on this page:
			
		pre
			code -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
			
		p.
			This property controls the application of sub-pixel rendering on WebKit-based browsers: Safari, Mobile Safari, Opera, and Chrome. It is particularly noticeable on displays that are not high in pixel density—for example, any device that is not a recent iPad, iPhone, or MacBook Pro. Without the #[code antialiased] value, text incorrectly appears heavier than it is supposed to, unless the font file has been deliberately optimized for this scenario. The vast majority are not.
			
		pre
			code -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
			
		p.
			Virtually identical to the property above, this controls the sub-pixel rendering of fonts on Mac OS X versions of Firefox.
			
		pre
			code text-rendering: geometricPrecision;
			
		p.
			This property applies all ligatures, and then also renders them at their utmost level of precision. While somewhat taxing on weaker devices displaying large amounts of text content, the legibility benefits seem worth it. More information on this and other values, and their effects, can be found #[a(href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-rendering", target="_blank") here].
